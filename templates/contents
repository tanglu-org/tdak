This file maps each file available in the Debian GNU/Linux system to
the package from which it originates.  It includes packages from the
DIST distribution for the ARCH architecture.

You can use this list to determine which package contains a specific
file, or whether or not a specific file is available.

When a file is contained in more than one package, all packages are
listed.
