				Notes
				=====

o Please be careful: dak sends out lots of emails and if not
  configured properly will happily send them to lots of people who
  probably didn't want those emails.

o Don't use the debian dak.conf, cron.* etc. as starting
  points for your own configuration files, they're highly Debian
  specific.  Start from scratch and refer to the security.debian.org
  config files (-security) as they're a better example for a private
  archive.

		    What do all these scripts do?
		    =============================

Generic and generally useful
----------------------------

o To process queue/:

  * dak process-upload - processes queue/unchecked
  * dak process-new - allows ftp administrator to process queue/new and queue/byhand
  * dak process-policy - processes policy queues (including new and byhand)

o To generate indices files:

  * dak dominate          - removes obsolete packages from suites
  * dak generate-packages-sources2 - generate Packages, Sources
  * dak generate-releases - generates Release

o To clean things up:

  * dak clean-suites - to remove obsolete files from the pool
  * dak clean-queues - to remove obsolete/stray files from the queue
  * dak rm - to remove package(s) from suite(s)
  * dak override - to change individual override entries

o Information display:

  * dak ls - shows information about package(s)
  * dak queue-report - shows information about package(s) in queue/
  * dak override - can show you individual override entries
  * dak graph - creates some pretty graphs of queue sizes over time

Generic and useful, but only for those with existing archives
-------------------------------------------------------------

o dak init-archive - initializes a projectb database from an existing archive

Generic but not overly useful (in normal use)
---------------------------------------------

o dak import-users-from-passwd - sync PostgreSQL users with system users
o dak cruft-report - check for obsolete or duplicated packages
o dak init-dirs - directory creation in the initial setup of an archive
o dak check-archive - various sanity checks of the database and archive
o dak control-overrides - manipulates/lists override entries
o dak control-suite - removes/adds/lists package(s) from/to/for a suite
o dak stats - produces various statistics
o dak find-null-maintainers - checks for users with no packages in the archive

Semi-generic
------------

To generate less-used indices files:

o dak make-maintainers - generates Maintainers file used by, e.g. debbugs
o dak make-overrides  - generates override.<foo> files

Mostly Debian(.org) specific
----------------------------

o dak security-install - wrapper for Debian security team
o dak import-ldap-fingerprints - syncs fingerprint and uid information with a debian.org LDAP DB

Very Incomplete or otherwise not generally useful
-------------------------------------------------

o dak init-db - currently only initializes a DB from a dak.conf config file
o dak check-overrides - override cruft checker that doesn't work well with New Incoming

Scripts invoked by other scripts
--------------------------------

o dak examine-package - invoked by 'dak process-new' to "check" NEW packages

			How do I get started?
